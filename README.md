# hurricane_analysis_project
This repository contais contains my code with respect to a project offered by Codecadey's path "Data Scientist: Natural Language Processing Specialist Career Path".

In this project information was provided by Codecademy with respect to some hurricanes.
More precisely a list with the names of the hurricanes under the alias "names"; a list with the months that these hurricanes took place under the alias "months"; a list with the years that each hurricane took place and a list with the arreas that these hurricanes affected under the alias "years" and "areas_affected" respectively. Moreover, two extra lists were provided containtind the values of the damages and the deaths that the hurricanes caused; the names of the variables for this list are "damages" and "deaths" respectively.
